# Pure3DRenderer
An elementary pure Java Orthographic Projection 3D Renderer created for MadHacks 2023. 

## Usage 
Requirements: Java 17+

Clone the repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/RamiE965/Pure3DRenderer
cd Pure3DRenderer
```

Use the Javac compiler to compile a .java file. Then run it using Java
```
javac Rendered3D.java
java Renderer3D.java
```
## Why? 
We built this 3D Renderer project purely for fun, without relying on APIs or libraries like OpenGL or WebGL to access the GPU and utilize more advanced techniques. Our goal was to create a simple, low-abstraction, and dependency-free Java-based renderer. 

The downside is that it's pretty slow and unoptimized. The upside of this is that we have a better understanding of graphics from the ground up and we'll feel more comfortable using OpenGL or any other similar tool in the future. It also serves as an excellent application for some of the linear algebra and multivariable caluclus concepts we've learned.  
 
## Demonstrations 
Note that the pictures are unrepresentative (especially the none tetrahedron ones) and I was unable to upload Gifs to Github for some reason.
